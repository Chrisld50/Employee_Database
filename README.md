# Employee_Database

# Description

The goal of this application was to create a database that stored information about a company and its employees utilizing javascript, mysql, npm, node.js and inquirer. I learned how to link a database thats created in mysql to node and be able to pull information about the database into the terminal using inquirer. I also learned how to make query calls to the database from a js file. I had difficulty when it came to the query calls and utilizing the proper CRUD operation to pull or add whatever information I needed to add. I also had difficulties when it came to calling things from the database and adding it to inquirer.
